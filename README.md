## Fundamental Logic

1. A chessboard is an 8x8 grid
2. A queen is a chess piece which can attack any piece located in the same row, samecolumn, or in any of the four diagonals.

## Features 

1. Can calculate all 92 possible solution to the eight queens problem.
2. Call setQueens(int Number_of_queens_to_create) to add the desired number of queens on the board.
3. Call setQueen(int row,int col) to manually assign a queen on chess board
